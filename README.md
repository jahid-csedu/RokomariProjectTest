# Project Short Description
- The project has 4 view pages in total(login, home, add contacts and view contacts)
- Pages are protected with proper access control as per guideline of the project
- There are 2 types of user roles (ADMIN, USER)
- For USER use username=user and password=user
- For ADMIN user username=admin and password=admin
- There is a script in the resources folder named data.sql where I have created the users and roles. the passwords are hashed by BCrypt. you can create as many users as you want but for this project I have handled 2 roles only.
- ADMIN can view contact list as well as add a contact
- USER can only view the contact list
- I have created 2 table in the database name users and roles and another table for many to many relationship of users and roles for user authentication

- Rest apis are secured with jwt authentication
- The project has basic error handling mechanism for rest apis
